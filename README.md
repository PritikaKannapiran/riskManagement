# RISK MANAGEMENT
Made as a part of Amex Makeathon 2023.

The project aims to address these challenges by developing an innovative risk management solution that leverages advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to predict and manage credit risk and market risk. The project intends to provide financial institutions with a robust and efficient framework for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals and forecasting market risks, enabling better risk mitigation strategies.

Our Solution focuses on automating the process of risk mitigation/ calculation by using past records of dataset collected by banks or other institutions. In real time, our solution proves to be the best fit because the models have been designed in a way that requires only new datasets.Further, with more knowledge of the processes, our models can be expanded to other types of risk mitigation techniques too. 

The effectiveness of our model is proven by the accuracy of **93.53%** that has been achieved for credit risk evaluation.

On the other hand , we calculate VaR for market risk which provides a simple and standardized method for measuring and managing financial risk. It helps identify potential losses under normal market conditions, manage capital and determine the amount of reserves needed to cover potential losses.
